# As Above • So Below — New Mythology

**As Above • So Below** visualizes the global hierarchy of wealth as a **dynamic night sky**.

Golden circles represent **billionaires** — figures elevated to near-mythological status — while blue-white circles mark **nations** and their populations.

The relative sizes of these circles reflect **global inequality**:  
in 2025, roughly **3.4%** of total household wealth is concentrated among the world’s **3,028 billionaires**, with the remaining **96.6%** held by everyone else.

### 🌌 How to Explore

- **Hover** over a nation to reveal its population, GDP per capita, and estimated billionaire count.  
- **Watch** as wealth dynamics unfold through celestial metaphors:
  - **Shooting stars** mark the rise and fall of fortunes.  
  - **Explosions** and fading halos visualize volatility.  
  - **Drifting orbs** merge and burst, maintaining a delicate cosmic balance.  

Each frame forms a living **data-driven artwork** — both image and dataset — continuously generated in real time.
